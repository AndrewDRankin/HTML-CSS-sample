				Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!
				<br>

				Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.
				<br>
				<br>
				Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Daylight and everything. I love you, buddy! Throw her in the brig. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.
				<br>
				<br>
				I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
				<br>
				<br>
				Kids have names? Tell them I hate them. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

				Your best is an idiot!

				Also Zoidberg. Ow, my spirit! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may beâ€¦
			</p>

			<h5>
				I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!
			</h5>

			<p>
				Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Can I use the gun? I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

			<h5>
				You lived before you met me?!
			</h5>

			<p>
				Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Oh God, what have I done? No, I'm Santa Claus! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!
